# Todo-list-with-php
A simple todo list with bootstrap and raw php.
Each user can manage their own tasks.

## How to run:
* You need a webserver to run the application.I used Apache, any other server can work eg Nginx or Litespeed
* U also need MySQL db server. 
* create a database and name it "todo"
* import 'todo.sql'  file in "todo" database
*  
* make sure you have active internet connection because i used bootstrap cdn . so without internet you will not show proper output
